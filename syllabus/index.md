### ENEE351: Theoretical Foundations of Computer Engineering

### Spring 2016

### Credits: 4

<br />

**Course Goals:**
This course teaches fundamental concepts in computer engineering, including topics in discrete math, data structures and algorithms. The course will also include a hands-on programming component. This course will provide students with the tools to design modular, time and space-efficient algorithms for real-world problems.

<br />

**Course prerequisites:**
ENEE150 and ENEE244

<br />

**Topic prerequisites:**
C programming

<br />

**Core topics:**

1.	Fundamental Concepts: Mathematical induction; Recursion; Combinatorics (counting); Discrete probability; Recurrence relations; Concepts and tools for analyzing algorithmic performance such as: work-depth, asymptotic notation, worst case, randomized and probabilistic complexity. 
2.	Core Data Structures: Stacks; Queues; Graphs; Trees; B-trees; Binary-search trees; Hash tables;Dictionaries; Heaps.
3.	Sorting Algorithms and their Analysis: Sorting: Insertion sort; Merge sort; Quicksort; Radix sort.
4.	Graph algorithms: Depth-first search; Breadth-first search; Shortest path; Minimum spanning tree; Topological sort;Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
5.	Algorithmic approaches: brute-force algorithms; greedy algorithms; divide-and-conquer; dynamic programming.
6.	Advanced Topics: Advanced (Tree) Data Structures, Max-flow/Min-cut, NP-Completeness, Parallel Computing.

<br />

**Tentative Topics for Programming Projects:**
1. Sorting (Radix Sort)
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Hash tables
4. Graph algorithms
5. FFT
